** Overview
Waldo is a 2D map client application designed to visualize and manage robot fleets using AWS IoT RoboRunner. It provides real-time spatial representations of robotic operations, enabling efficient monitoring and coordination within industrial environments.

** Challenges
- *Real-Time Visualization:* Rendering dynamic positions and movements of multiple robots simultaneously.
- *Scalability:* Supporting various robot types and fleet sizes without compromising performance.
- *Integration:* Seamlessly interfacing with AWS IoT RoboRunner's APIs for data retrieval and command execution.

** Solutions
- *WebSocket Communication:* Implemented WebSocket connections to receive real-time updates on robot statuses and locations.
- *Efficient Rendering Engine:* Developed a lightweight rendering engine capable of handling numerous entities on the map concurrently.
- *Modular Integration Layer:* Created an abstraction layer to facilitate easy integration with AWS IoT RoboRunner's APIs.

** Implementation
1. *Data Ingestion:* Utilized AWS IoT RoboRunner's data streams to gather real-time information on robot positions and tasks.
2. *Map Rendering:* Leveraged HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to render a 2D map displaying robot locations and trajectories.
3. *User Interaction:* Enabled features such as zooming, panning, and robot selection to enhance user experience.
4. *Command Interface:* Integrated controls allowing users to send commands to individual robots directly from the map interface.

** Technologies Used
- *AWS IoT RoboRunner:* Provided the backend infrastructure for robot fleet management. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- *WebSockets:* Facilitated real-time communication between the client and server.
- *HTML5 Canvas:* Enabled efficient 2D rendering within web browsers.
- *JavaScript Frameworks:* Utilized React.js for building a responsive user interface.

** Conclusion
Waldo enhances operational efficiency by providing a real-time, interactive visualization tool for managing robot fleets through AWS IoT RoboRunner. Its scalable design and seamless integration capabilities make it a valuable asset for industrial automation.
